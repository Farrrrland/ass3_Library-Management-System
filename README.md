To start the system, just first edit your usrname and pwd in 

    library.go 

in order to connect to your local database. ( If this is the first time you open this system, plz use an empty db or the system may do nothing )
Then, run library.go, follow the instructions to set up and use the system.
You can also use

    library_test.go 

to test the functions in library.go. You should read it briefly because some fuctions may be unable to test with library_test.go.
